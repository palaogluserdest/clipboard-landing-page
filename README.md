## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I tried to make a simple project by separating it into components with scss structure. I tried to use flex structure. Since I do not know the responsive part of the scss structure yet, I did not include it for this project.



### Continued development

When I learn some of the responsive design in the scss structure, I will update it.
